# <Project 1: Get In Your Feels>

## Description

Project #1 challenged our group to create a website that adhered to the following acceptance criteria:

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
    - Our project utilizes a simple style guide called Skeleton.

- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
    - Out project is deployed to the following link:

- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
    - This website is interactive in that it asks the user to select a "mood" from the dropdown menu, after which it will produce random content related to that mood. The content is produced by utilizing a keyword search to request the content in both the Youtube and Mixcloud APIs.

- Use at least two server-side APIsLinks to an external site.
    - Youtube API appears as a video player
    - Mixcloud API appears as a widget song player

- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
    - Under the section "Saved Content:" you will see a "Last Playlist" button populate after each search, this will save the previous Youtube playlist populated and play it again.

- Be responsive.
    - You will see that the webpage is responsive for smaller screens, adjusting in size.

- Have a polished UI.
    - The UI is clean, and demonstrates the desired content in an organized manner.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
    - You will see that the repository has the appropriate file structure, that multiple branches were committed for various features by various group memebrs.
    - The index, javascript and css are appropriately formatted and easily read, there are comments throughout explaining the code

- Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).
    - Refer to this document

- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.
    - What: An app that suggests multiple entertainment options based on a mood that a user enters or selects
    - Why: As a user, I want to be presented with random content related to my current mood so that I can be entertained
    - How: Using 2 APIs (Youtube, Mixcloud) that produce the random content

## Installation

1. The first step was to set up the HTML with the following containers:
    - A form with a dropdown menu for mood options to select from, and a button with an event listener to generate the content.
    - A div for the "saved content" where local storage will populate when the mood is submitted.
    - A div to hold the Youtube player, and a div to hold the MixCloud widget

2. Variables were created to hold the following: mood form, submit button, Youtube videos, and songs. There was a variable created to hold the Youtube API key, as well as various video parameters that acted as filters for the requested Youtube content (so that no copyright videos would be displayed, and no broken links).

3. An empty array was created each for the random videos to be generated by Youtube API, and an empty array to hold old searches for local storage.

4. The event listener attached to the mood selection submit button calls the function that will generate the random Youtube video content related to the mood.

5. The Youtube content generator function uses fetch to request the Youtube data, we request 10 random videos related to the mood keyword, and then randomize them into an array to be played for the user. The videos are played in a playlist format. The videos are displayed using the Youtube API video player.

6. Once a video starts playing, a "Last Playlist" button also populates that holds the identical array of the playlist of videos to local storage. If a mood is re-selected or changed in the dropdown, a new button will appear to hold that new playlist, and the old button will remain and hold the old playlist. Clicking on either of the buttons will replay that exact playlist.

7. MIXCLOUD STEPS

## Usage

To use the webpage, you will click the dropdown menu under "Select yoour mood" and select a mood. Then you will submit on the button "Get In Your Feels."

You will see a random Youtube playlist populate that is related to that selected mood. You will also see a random song playlist populate from MixCloud with mood-related songs.

You can click on the Youtube video or song widget to play either content. You can also advance to the next Youtube video or next song in each playlist to get another mood-related song. the Youtube playlist holds 10 songs, and the song widget holds 19 songs.

You can access a previous Youtube playlist by clicking on the "Last Playlist" button that appears under "Saved content." Then you will be presented with your last search.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
